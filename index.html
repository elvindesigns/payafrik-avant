              </h2>
              <p>
                Before now, major investments (Stocks) have been left to the
                business moguls and millionaires who plug in millions into the
                market and take huge profits. The average(common) man finds it
                difficult to play at that stage considering the large capital
                requirements and cost of having middle men(brokers) to manage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the same vein most companies (Small & Large) have been
                relegated over the years because of lack of funds and the
                unavailability of platforms that enable investors(Small & Big)
                to invest and own shares/stakes in such companies.
              </p>
              <p>

          <div class="answers">
            <p>
              While valuation models differ, payafrik SPV has chosen to value
              Ripple Labs (at least in part) based on the market capitalization
              of XRP, its digital token.  Ripple Labs itself provides access to
              XRP market capitalization at
              https://ripple.com/xrp/market-performance/. What is not included
              in this valuation is the impact of the licensing/subscription
              revenue Ripple Labs is bringing in as a result of its licensing
              model or the critical mass of financial institutions it has
              amassed over the course of the last year. While many draw a
              distinction between Enterprise Value (EV) and Market
              Capitalization (Market Cap), each measures a company’s market
              value.  The key to notes is that the terms are not
              interchangeable. Market Cap is the most simplified way to
              calculate a company’s size, value and growth/risk outlook,
              measuring the value of a company based on stock price alone.  EV,
              on the other hand, arguable creates a more accurate value of a
              company because it takes into consideration its debt obligations.
              While EV gives a more comprehensive view of a company’s worth, we
              have elected to keep the valuation as simple as possible.

              Most Ripple Labs shares are held by institutional investors like
              1. Santander, RRE and Google Ventures. Likely, there are shares
              out there for sale, but we do not know of any directly given the
              cap table includes only a small group of investors. So, it a rare
              opportunity to join the like of google ventures to own stake in
              the same company they hold shares in
